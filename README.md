# Image-Mosaics
Warping and stitching two images using Homography matrix. Here, an image stitcher that uses image warping and homographies to automatically
create an image mosaic is implemented. We will focus on the case where we have two input images that should form the mosaic, where we warp one image into the plane of the second image and display the combined views.

# Examples
Displaying the input image, warped and merged images:

![Img2](/Img2.JPG)
